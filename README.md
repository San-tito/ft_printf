# Printf
![Build](https://github.com/San-tito/ft_printf/actions/workflows/c.yml/badge.svg)

The Printf project involves reprogramming the printf() function in C, providing a custom version that mimics the behavior of the original printf() from the standard library. The goal is to create a library, libftprintf.a, containing a function named ft_printf(). This function should replicate the functionality of the standard printf() with a focus on handling various conversion specifiers.
# Usage

- Compilation Instructions
To compile the project and create the library, you can use the following commands:


    ```bash
    make
    ```
This will generate a libftprintf.a library file that you can link to your programs.
